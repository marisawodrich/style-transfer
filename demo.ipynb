    "# Artistic Style Transfer \n",

    "## **1 Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Artistic style transfer aims at transferring the style of a given image to an artistic style. It allows to take any photopraph and any artistic work one likes and creates a version of that photograph in the style (meaning the same colors, brushstroke, and art specific patterns) of the specific artwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, Gatys and colleagues proposed a deep neural network (DNN) to perform artistic style transform on any given image. Their approach is based on the following finding: Visualizing the reconstructions of images that are processed with the object recognition network VGG, the researchers found that the image content gets increasingly precise along the layers of the convolutional neural network. At the same time, they found that style can be reconstructed using the correlation of the feature maps in each layer. Gatys and colleagues used this finding to generate new images that contain the content of a content image and the style of an artistic style image. They do so by iteratively adapting the generated image by applying the obtained gradients to the generated image. Those gradients get smaller and the image gets adapted less, the more the content of the generated image matches that of the original content image while also precisely capturing the style of the original style image. The overall loss to calculate the gardients in each iteration is computed using the sum of a content and a style loss. The relation of those two losses can be adapted with a content weight and a style weight - which in the end determine the how much content and style are represented in the final, generated image. The following image depicts the generated result (bottom) of the artistic style transfer from the following code using the example of a sunflower image (top) and the style of the artist James Rizzy (middle).\n",
